this is a simple card game in which computer acting as two opponents tries to beat each other.

the logic is, we suffle the cards we generated and than distribute them to the players.

now what is happening is that ....
they both take turns and at each turn they ramove one card from their deck and 
compare it with the card of the other player and who so evers' card has greater value wins that round and
this continues until some one left with no card.

if the compared cards have same value than a situation of war arises,
in which the take another card and who so ever wins keep the all the card on the war.
